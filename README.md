# Playlists
IPTV and Radio Streams with a special focus on News and Information channels. Mostly freely available. Focus is on streams that are not geoblocked and fully accessible in Australia, mostly in English but including International non English in that playlist.  

All streams are tested to work in Kodi various versions and operating systems and with IPTV Simple Client, and IPTV Merge Addons! They should also work in players like VLC and Potplayer, but the Youtube links may not work at this stage.

Youtube links require the Youtube addon in Kodi and are only added in cases where there is no other source for the stream, or where it is encrypted in other sources! 

This is for personal use only and has been used by myself for over 5 years. It is great to be able to access a wide variety of News Channels when a big event happens. The non English channels are useful for a window into other countries News broadcasts even if you cannot understand the broadcast language but also can be handy for learning other languages or learning about cultures.
